# SampleSite (Salon Website)
Source code for a now retired website that I developed for a beauty salon when I was first starting to learn web development.

The design was made in photoshop with the aid of a talented designer and input from the business owner, and I implemted the design with HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery and PHP.
