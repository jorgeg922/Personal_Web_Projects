#Beatuy Salon Website

This project contains the source code for a now retired website that I developed for a beauty salon when I was first starting to learn web development in the Summer of 2016.

Using the Software Development Lifecycle - Agile Methodology, I defined the requirements with aid of my client and upon the creationg of a backlog I split the development process into one-week sprints where I would report on the status of the project. 

During the first week, I designed the site in Photoshop. During the second week after receiving feedback from the client, the design was modified. In the third week I translated the design into code and put it through functionality testing. During the fourth week, after receiving final input from the client, I amde minor touch-ups in the stylesheet, and the product was delivered.

As part of the development of the website, the languages and tools used included HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript, PHP and Notepad++ to develop the different components of the site. I also integrated Google Maps through the use of an API key from Google.
