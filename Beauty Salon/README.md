#Beatuy Salon Website

This project contains the source code for a now retired website that I developed for a beauty salon when I was first starting to learn web development in the Summer of 2016.

By using the Software Development Lifecycle - Agile Methodology, the site's requirements were defined with aid from the business owner and upon the creationg of a backlog, the development process was split into one-week sprints. 

During the first week, the site was designed in Photoshop. During the second week after receiving feedback from the client, the design was modified. In the third week the design was translated into code and underwent functionality testing. And during the fourth week, after receiving final input from the client, minor touch-ups were made in the stylesheet, and the product was delivered.

As part of the development of the website, the languages and tools used included HTML, CSS, Jquery, Javascript, PHP and Notepad++ to develop the different components of the site. I also integrated Google Maps through the use of an API key from Google.
